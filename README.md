## Project Description
(Battle Game) is a multi-player turn based combat game that is played online. This game allows player to battle each other using customized characters. This project was inspired by many of the games that the developers played growing up. This game was built to satisfy the requirements for project 2 of the UT Austin coding bootcamp.

4) If you created a game you will now be taken to a waiting room until a second player joins the game. While in the waiting room you will be presented with a unique game ID, You will need to share that code with your friend so they can join the game.
